How to Install Mods on Your PC (client-side)
Start by logging into the Steam app.
Start Steam, go to your Library, right-click 7 Days to Die, and then click Browse Local Files.

In your 7 Days to Die local files, create a new folder named Mods. It's time to download the mods you'd like to use.
Locate and download those particular mods. 
Using a program such as 7Zip or WinRAR, unzip those mods(using an empty folder can help with ensuring the mod is unzipped properly). Mods will unzip generally in this format: \ModFolder1\ModFolder2\ModInfo.xml\
For mods, you would only need the folder that contains the ModInfo.xml file. That would mean in the above example, you would only pull and keep \ModFolder2\ModInfo.xml\.
You would then place that folder containing the ModInfo.xml file into the Mods folder in your 7 Days to Die local files.
Repeat this for each mod downloaded. Once done, start 7 Days to Die and this will load the mods.
